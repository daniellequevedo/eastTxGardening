				<h3>The Benefits</h3>
				<p>There a several benefits to taking up vegetable gardening. It can be fun, relaxing, and therapeutic.
					It can also be very convenient to bring in vegetables from the backyard as opposed to the grocery
					store.  And lastly, it's healthy; it's easier to eat vegetables when there's so many available
					from your garden.

				<h3>The Tools</h3>
				<p>Every gardener needs a reliable set of tools:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>A Spade Shovel</strong><br />
						If you're not using raised beds filled with bagged dirt
						and your garden will be planted directly in the ground, then 
						you'll need a spade shovel for breaking ground
						when you first start your garden each season.</li>		
						
					<li><strong>A Hoe</strong><br />
						You'll also need a sturdy hoe of good quality 
						for maintaining your garden.</li>
						
					<li><strong>A Garden Trowel</strong><br />
						If your garden is small and/or easy to reach 
						(less than 100 square feet or you have
						raised beds that are higher than your knees), then a 
						garden trowel will work fine in place of a spade and hoe.
						The spade and hoe are more for big jobs.</li>
						
					<li><strong>A Small Paring Knife</strong><br />
						This is good for thinning out crowded seedlings, no matter your garden's size.</li>
						
				</ul>
				<p>And remember to always keep your tools clean and sharp!</p>

				<h3>Gardening Basics</h3>
				<p>There are a few basic lessons I've learned since I first started vegetable gardening:</p>

					<h4>Water</h4>
					<p>Make sure you have a way to easily water your garden, either
						through a sprinkler system or drip irrigation with soaker hoses.
						Check your garden daily to make sure it's getting enough water.
						At the same time, don't over-water.</p>

					<h4>Fertilize</h4>
					<p>Always fertilize a week or so before you plant. And it's best to use an
						organic fertlizer. <em>Gardening When it Counts</em> by Steve Solomon
						teaches you all about organic fertilizer in the first chapter.<p>

					<h4>Plan Ahead!</h4>
					<p>If you're planting tomato plants, put the tomato cage around
						around them while they're still small.  If you're planting climbing
						peas or climbing beans, install the wall of plastic mesh or 
						chicken wire first, then sow the seeds right under the mesh / wire.  
						It's also good to think about what plants grow best when
						planted near each other (Companion Planting), and to consider
						last year's garden plan when creating the one for this year 
						(Succession Planting). Also pick a spot that'll be sheltered
						from strong winds, but will also have full sun from at least 10am
						to 4pm.</p>

					<h4>To Everything There Is A Season</h4>
					<p>Don't go planting Okra in November. You'll just be wasting seeds.  
						Each vegetable has one or two specific windows a year in which
						it's best to be planted.  Plants that are sown outside of their
						window simply won't flourish (unless of course you have a fancy 
						climate-controlled greenhouse). The
						<a href="http://easttexasgardening.tamu.edu/homegardens/VEGeTABLE.html" target="_blank">
						Texas A&amp;M East Texas Gardening website</a> has a list of planting
						dates for a variety of vegetables.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Whenever Possible, Plant From Seed</h4>
					<p>It's tempting to bring home small starter plants from Wal-Mart or HomeDepot
						and transplant them in your garden.  But chances are they'll never grow as big 
						and strong and ones you planted straight from seed. Remember, patience
						is a virtue!

				<h3>Deeper Topics</h3>
				<p>If you really want to be an expert gardener, you'll want
					to explore these topics as well:</p>
					
					<div id="companions">
						<h4>Companion Planting</h4>
						<p>Some plants do well when planted together. Some are best kept apart:</p>
							
							<div id="companionsList">
								<p>Grow These Together:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Icicle Radishes help keep squash bugs off of Squash plants.</li> 
									<li>Pea plants fix the level of nitrogen in the soil, making it perfect for Carrots.</li>
									<li>Okra protects the more fragile Bell Pepper plant from strong winds.</li>
								</ul>
							</div> <!-- end #companionsList-->
							
							<div id="nonCompanionsList">
								<p>Keep These Apart:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Potatoes have a greater chance of developing phytophthora blight when grown near cucumbers.</li>
									<li>The growth of cabbage, broccoli, and brussel sprouts are inhibted by strawberries.</li>
									<li>The growth of beans is inhibited by onions, garlic, shallots, and chives.</li>
								</ul>
							</div> <!-- end #nonCompanionsList-->
					</div> <!-- end #companions-->
					
					<div id="deepTopicsContinued">
						<h4>Succession Planting (Crop Rotation)</h4>
						<p>Always keep a record of what you planted and where you planted it.
							Different vegetables pull different nutrients out of the soil, and they also
							replace different nutrients in the soil. So it's best to
							plant everything in a particular order. 
							<a href="http://www.growveg.com/growguides/crop-rotation.aspx" target="_blank">
							Growveg.com</a> is a good website to check out for Succession Planting.
						</p>
						
									
						<h4>Organic vs. Non-Organic</h4>
						<p>Organic vegetables means they were grown without pesticides and chemical fertilizers.
							If you're buying seeds, look for <em>organic</em> seeds. That means they came from
							plants that were grown organically.
						</p>
							
						<h4>Hybrid vs. Non-Hybrid</h4>
						<p>All store-bought vegetables and store-bought seed packets today are Hybrids,
							meaning they're a mix of more than one plant variety&#8212;Several
							varieties may have been cross-bred to result in bigger, hardier plants.
							Often, this involves genetic modification, including "terminator genes" that
							prevent you from being able to re-use seeds from the same set of plants year after year.
							With Non-Hyrid seeds (also known as open-pollenated or heirloom seeds), on the other hand, 
							you can save the seeds and replant every time, and you'll get a consistent 
							variety year after year.  These are no different than the seeds used a hundred
							years ago.  The only way to get Non-Hybrid seeds is by purchasing 
							them online. <a href="http://rareseeds.com/shop/" target="_blank">
							Baker Creek</a> is a good website for Non-Hybrid, non-Genetically Modified seeds.
